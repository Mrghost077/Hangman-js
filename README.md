# Hangman Game in Python

## 🎯 About the Project

This is a simple guessing game built using HTML, CSS & Javascript. The player has to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of tries. The game provides hints using underscores, and incorrect guesses lead to a visual representation of a hangman being drawn.

## 📌 How to Play

1. Run the script in a Browser
2. The game will randomly select a word and display its hidden representation (\_ \_ \_ \_).
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the hint.
